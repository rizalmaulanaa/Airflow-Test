For explaination on the task, please check inside the folder README.md. I also would like to explain that I currently can't run the full DAG for get all the result, bacause of the scheduler in my laptop is error (so only can run the DAG once, even the schedule_interval already @daily). But I think the DAG still work fine. If you want to test the DAG you can run (trigger) the DAG with config and input the start date same as the DAG python file.
